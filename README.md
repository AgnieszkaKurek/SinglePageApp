          SinglePageApp
  It is a project  of simple webside. Webside was created using programing language:  html, CSS,  JavaScript and frameworks:  AngularJS and Bootstrap.
It is simple creator of events, containing  panel regisration  and  panel  creating events. Webpage is adressed  to  lovers 
pigs (domestic pigs, micro pigs and others). Webpage don't have  a connection  to databasa yet (is only fron-end side). This project is not completed yet.
In the future, I want to improve the  apperance and functionality of webpage. If you want to webpage work on your browser, you
must clone "SinglePageApp" repository and  give command "bower install" on the command line.
