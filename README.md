#SinglePageApp


To run a website on browser you need to have installed on your computer node.js and bower,next  clone "SinglePageApp" repository  and give command  "bower install" on the command line. Disregard these activity,  make  that website does not work (frameworks to angular and  bootstrap they are in file .gitignore â€“ reduced to project weight).

 ##"SinglePageApp" is  humorous, simple website  addressed  to pigs lovers (domestic pigs, micro pigs and others).
On  web page you can put information  about events  targeted at people interested  in the subject of pigs (animal exhibition, panel discussions  on vegetarianism and veganism, theme party. In the future,  the website  will function search events.
##Website was created using languages: html, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks: angular ()  and bootstrap. It is simple creator of events, containing  panel registration  and  panel  creating events. This project is not completed yet. Web page does not have a connection  to database yet (is only fron-end site). In the future, I want to improve the  appearance and functionality of web page. The application still does not work properly - work on the improvement continues!!!
